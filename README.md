This is a *very* primitive disassembly of the Watford Electronics release of AMS's Stop Press v1.9 for the BBC Micro. The goal of the disassembly was just to understand the code enough to try combining the two ROMs into a single 32K "Computer Concepts"-style PALPROM.

The ROMs and associated discs were obtained from [My BBC Master's AMX Mouse software page](http://www.mybbcmaster.nl/other_amx_mouse.html).
